      <h1>Home Server Build</h1>
      <div class="metadata">
        Published on September 9, 2024 | By Luke Patterson

    <article class="content">
      <p>
        After years of relying on cloud/streaming services, I decided to take
        control of my data, media, and wallet by building my own home server.
        This project has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'd like to
        share my experience with you.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Build a Home Server?</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by Kyle Chayka's "<a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Filterworld-How-Algorithms-Flattened-Culture/dp/0385548281"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Filter World</a
        >," I began reflecting on how algorithmic recommendations and streaming
        services were shaping my media consumption. I realized I was spending
        more on subscriptions while having less meaningful control over my
        digital life. Building a home server became my way of reclaiming agency
        over my data and media choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the practical benefits of data control and privacy, running your
        own server creates a more intentional relationship with technology.
        Instead of letting algorithms decide what I should watch or listen to
        next, I now curate my own media library. This deliberate approach has
        made my entertainment choices more meaningful and less driven by
        automated suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technical advantages are significant too - from faster local network
        speeds to the ability to customize every aspect of my setup. My media is
        now also available offline, for free, forever. Plus, the learning
        experience of building and maintaining the system has been invaluable
        for my understanding of modern technology infrastructure.
      </p>

      <h2>Hardware Specifications</h2>
      <p>Total build cost: $720.00 (including taxes and shipping)</p>
      <p>
        The primary consideration for this build was power efficiency, as the
        server runs 24/7. Inspired by this excellent
        <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1935nar/homelab_nas_v2_power_efficient_build/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >power-efficient NAS build</a
        >
        from r/homelab, I focused on components that provide a good balance
        between performance and minimal power consumption. The system typically
        draws less than 50W under normal usage.

      <p>
        I run
        <a href="https://unraid.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Unraid</a
        >
        as my operating system, which provides an excellent balance of storage
        management, docker support, and ease of use. For media management, I use
        <a href="https://www.plex.tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Plex</a
        >
        as my central hub for movies, TV shows, music, photos, and audiobooks.
        The Plex ecosystem, particularly PlexAmp, has completely replaced
        streaming services on my mobile devices, giving me access to my entire
        music and audiobook library with a polished listening experience.

      <h3>Docker Containers</h3>
      <p>
        Unraid's docker support makes it easy to run various services. My main
        containers include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>MakeMKV:</strong> For ripping my Blu-ray collection to digital
          formats

      <h2>How I Source My Media</h2>

          <img
            src="librarymovies.JPG"
            alt="Collection of Blu-rays from the library"
          />
          <img
            src="librarymedia.JPG"
            alt="Various media types available at the library"
          />
        </div>
        <figcaption>
          A typical haul of Blu-rays and CDs from my local library
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        My local public library has been an incredible resource for building my
        media collection. With an extensive catalog of Blu-rays, CDs, ebooks,
        and audiobooks available for free checkout, I've been able to digitize a
        vast collection of movies, TV shows, music, and books. The library's
        commitment to maintaining a diverse and current collection means I
        always have access to both new releases and classic content.
      </p>

      <h2>A Note About Music</h2>
      <p>
        While my server handles digital playback beautifully, my primary music
        listening happens on vinyl. There's something special about the ritual
        of selecting a record, placing it on the turntable, and experiencing the
        music as a complete album. This intentional listening approach perfectly
        complements my philosophy of mindful media consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        For mobile listening, I use PlexAmp to stream my digital collection. Its
        thoughtful interface and high-quality playback make it the perfect
        bridge between my carefully curated music library and modern streaming
        convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I do listen digitally, I prioritize high-quality sources: either
        lossless rips from my CD collection or digital purchases made directly
        from artists. As a musician myself (<a
          href="https://whosavedwho.band"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Who Saved Who</a
        >), I'm a strong believer in supporting fellow artists. I regularly
        purchase albums through Bandcamp (where artists receive a larger share
        of sales) or iTunes when that's the artist's preferred platform. These
        high-quality, DRM-free files ensure I can enjoy my favorite artists'
        work indefinitely while knowing I've contributed to their ability to
        create more music.

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently experimenting with creating my own private internet by
        archiving complete copies of my favorite websites. This project is
        inspired by the idea of digital preservation and the desire to maintain
        access to content that might otherwise disappear. I'm particularly
        interested in preserving gaming websites and their associated content,
        ensuring these digital artifacts remain accessible even if the original
        sites go offline.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal isn't just backup - it's about creating a curated, offline
        version of the internet that contains the content I find most valuable.
        This approach aligns with my broader philosophy of maintaining control
        and intentionality in my digital life.
